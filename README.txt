Welcome to Clang UPC.  This is a compiler front-end for the C family
of languages (C, UPC, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++) which
is built as part of the LLVM compiler infrastructure project.

Unlike many other compiler frontends, Clang UPC is useful for a number
of things beyond just compiling code: we intend for Clang UPC to be
host to a number of different source level tools.  One example
might be a Clang UPC Static Analyzer, which provides similar
capabilities to the Clang Static Analyzer.

For details on how to build, install, and use Clang UPC,
consult the wiki at:
